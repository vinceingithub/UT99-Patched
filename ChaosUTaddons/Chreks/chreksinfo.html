model :<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
Double click on the "Chrekinstall.umod" and then point the install programm to 
your UnrealTournament directory. The Chreks were meant for ChaosUT, but of course 
they also work with standart UT and any other mod. (But this would be blasphemy! 
;) </font><br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chreks - their 
  history </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first historical 
  dated appearance was about 140 years ago, during an exploration mission in the 
  Orthak system, the honored and well-known Skaarj "expansion force" Shra'thuk 
  stumbled on one of the outer rim planets over a small anthill like structure 
  hidden in one of the thousands side canyons which dominate the surface of Orthak9. 
  Its inhabitants were small, spider-like creatures of the size of a nali rabbit. 
  Because of the cute look of their oversized snaileyes, Ro'lak, the commander, 
  decided to gather some of them for his childern at home...and maybe also for 
  the case their food rations wouldn't be sufficient for the long march back to 
  the landing pod. Well, three of them survived the trip home (and the hungry 
  stomachs of the team) and became pets for the childern's daily desire for torture. 
  Later the commander hat to realize what an annoying mistake he made. Already 
  at the size of a warcow the two last Chreks decided to eat their tormentors 
  for breakfast and started to dig a nest below the commander's sleeping cave 
  using the rests of the Skaarj childern's bodies as food for a complete new Chrek 
  population. Two months later when Ro'lak came back from another mission to his 
  home at Ni'var6 he realized in shock that his family was gone and his home planet 
  was set in quarantine, gotten completely populated by this nasty creatures. 
  The Skaarj elders decided that no more ships were allowed to land on their former 
  small military outpost, but they knew that it was only a matter of time that 
  the not-so-dumb Chreks, now confronted with a technology they weren't able to 
  reproduce before, will be able to understand how to use it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chreks - their 
  biology </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As said before, 
  Chreks are similar to the Caldurian spiders, but using 4 legs for walking/fighting 
  an 4 for more practical things. They are very curious about new things, and 
  also very aware of their surrounding, which is not only proven because of their 
  big eyes. Chreks are able to "link their minds", we guess by telepaphy, which 
  means that one of them maybe seems dumb, but 20 of them can try to figure out 
  how to use a modern weapon or steer a spaceship. The "role within the community" 
  is given already geneticly before birth, and in most cases you can see the single 
  Chrek's purpose by the form of their eyes (guard, hunter, observer, etc.) They 
  too have the ability to recolor certain parts of their skin using flexible pigments, 
  which they normaly do during fights to state their group membership. Last tip: 
  don't call them "bugs"!!! I'm not happy I did this once during the rescue attempt 
  of Ni'var6 but I AM happy they at least let me keep my second arm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tech info : 
  </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Chreks are 
  my very first custom player model... so have mercy in case the animations don't 
  look that smooth sometimes... I only did mainly technical animations in ChaosUT 
  to this point.<br>
  Currently they only have of one basic skin (inclusive 4 extra color skins, same 
  theme) and 6 different faces. <br>
  <b><br>
  Extra goodie 1:</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This package also 
  contains two extra voice packages (based on the Male2 &amp; Female2 voice packs 
  of UT) called &quot;Chrekdozer&quot; and &quot;Chrekscout&quot;... they should 
  make the &quot;Chrekexperience&quot; a bit more monster-style. You can choose 
  them (like any other voicepack) in the Player Setup Menu and during customizing 
  your bots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Extra goodie 
  2:<br>
  <br>
  </b>In a new subdirectory below your UnrealTournament dir called <b>&quot;\ChaosUTaddons\Chreks&quot;</b> 
  you will find a special Chrek desktop wallpaper...have much fun with it... different 
  resolutions are available in the Art corner of our homepage at <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/chaotic">http://www.planetunreal.com/chaotic

  <b>Extra goodie 3:</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in <b>&quot;\ChaosUTaddons\Chreks&quot;</b> 
  there are three additional JPEG files showing the Chreks texture wireframes. 
  Just in case you are a skin artist and would like to make a custom skin for 
  it. If you want to or already did, don't hesitate and mail me at <a href="mailto:spa@planetquake.com">spa@planetquake.com</a>
