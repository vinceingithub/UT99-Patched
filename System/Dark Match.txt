*** Dark Match ***

Yep, it's back and it's never, ever gonna die! =)
Let me tell you a story; *ahem*
i bought unreal. i loved unreal. my dad said it sucked(he couldn't figure out how to move forward and backwards (he's an idiot) so he hated unreal.). I loved dark match. I played it over and over and over till my head exploded, making a horrible mess. My dad, being stupid but very nice, bought me Unreal Tournament. So shocked was i when i discovered that DK was DOA. I set forth on a most righteous quest to save my beloved DK, and after 3 long days of studying Unreal Script, Dark Match Mutator was born *wipes tear from eye* oh god that's beautiful. Enjoy the mutator, cause you won't have to worry about campers when you play DK-ASSAULT ;)
