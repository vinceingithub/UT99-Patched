		    -----====CORPSEMANIA=====-----
v1.04a
-------------
Installation:
-------------
1. run corpsemania.umod and follow the instructions.
2. make sure "CorpseMania" is in your server packages if you are going
   to start a server.

-----------
Game Modes:
-----------
1. DeathMatch: This game mode is like Last Man Standing but with a twist.
   Everyone has a set amount of lives and when your lives run out you
   become an immortal zombie(walk slowly, can only throw gibs, glow green,
   etc.). As an immortal zombie you have
   to try to kill the other players that aren't zombies. The last
   player that's not a zombie wins.

2. ZombieBeatDown: The Undead are rising from the ground for vengence against
   the living and there's only one thing to do, grab your chainsaw. In this
   game mode all of the players are on the same side with a set amount of lives
   and a time limit. You have to try to survive for the time limit without losing
   all of your lives. Hard to do considering that everywhere you look there are
   Undead coming out of the ground. As long as one player is still alive everyone wins.
   * You can also be on 4 different squads or not be on anyones squad.  You can select
   your squad color the same way you do in ctf(by going into player setup and changing your
   team color).  No matter what squad you are on though everyone is still on the same side
   in ZombieBeatDown.

3. GibCollect: Everyone is becoming a Zombie and there's only one way to stop it,
   eat the most gibs.  The only way to score points in GibCollect is to collect gibs.
   Whoever collects the set amount of gibs first and then kills another player wins.

--------------
Extra Options:
--------------
1. Lives: Sets how many Lives you have.
2. Gibs: Sets how many Gibs you have to collect in GibCollect.
3. Time Limit: How long you have to survive for in the ZombieBeatDown game mode.
4. Rate of Undead: Sets how fast the Undead spawn in the ZombieBeatDown game mode.
5. Amount of Gibs: Sets how many gibs spawn when people die.
6. Ai Zombies: Check if you want Ai Zombies to spawn out of player carcasses.
7. DarkMode: Dims the lights down on the map and makes it dark.
8. ExessiveMode: Changes some of the skins and makes random events(exploding bodies,
   random grenades, more kamizombies, etc.).
9. ChainSawMode: Takes all of the weapons out of the level and makes everyone only
   have a chainsaw.
10. Max Undead: Sets the max amount of Undead that can spawn in the ZombieBeatDown game mode.

----------------
Types Of Undead:
----------------
1. Zombie: These are your everyday gib throwing, not very bright,
   slow moving zombies
2. KamiZombie:  These are your everyday self-destructing, slightly
   faster then normal zombies. 
3. ZombieMaster: This type of zombie is bigger then a normal zombie
   and has more life. If you see one of these make sure you kill it
   fast because everytime one of his thrown gibs hits the ground a
   zombie will spawn there. 
4. Ghost: This Undead is transperant, shoots blue tazers,
   and flys around the level looking for the living. 
5. Ghoul: These are the general Undead bigbosses. They throw fireballs
   and if you get too close to them they will punch/throw you away.  

------------
UndeadPacks:
------------
   UndeadPacks are mutators specially made for CorpseMania that replace the original Undead
   with anything from Skaarj to Grenades.  You can mix and match UndeadPacks and load up as
   many as you want as a time.  For instructions on how to install and make your own
   UndeadPacks load up the UndeadPacks.txt file that came with CorpseMania.zip.
