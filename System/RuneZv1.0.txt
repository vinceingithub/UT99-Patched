What is "RuneZ v1.0"?
"RuneZ v1.0" is a mutator for the Unreal Tournament Demo, and it may 
work with the full version of UT. (Won't know till Epic Releases it). 
It adds a series of new powerups to the game, called "Runes". Different 
"Runes" give you different abilities.

What types of "Runes" are there?
Well, Runes can be broken up into three categories:

	OFFENSIVE:
	These Runes affect the way you do damage, and are unrelated to 
	your health. They are:

	Strength Rune: While you have this "Rune", you do 2x Damage.

	Pestilence Rune: Everything around you takes some damage

	DEFENSIVE:
	These Runes affect your Health/Resistence to Damage. They are:

	Regen Rune: Your health slowly regenerates up to 150%.

	Resist Rune: You take only half damage.

	OTHER:
	These Runes affect both your Offensive and Defensive abilities, 
	or neither. They include:

	Vampire Rune: Whenever you hit some one, you get 50% of the 
	damage you dealt added to your health.

	Barb Rune: Whenever you hit some one who has this rune, you will 
	take 50% of the damage you dealt. Becareful of using a strength rune/damage amplifier/fully loaded eightball on someone with this rune, as you will instantly kill yourself.

Cool, is there anything else?
Yes there is! You can customize the number of Runes spawned from a 
UWindows dialog. (Select the "Mods" drop down from the menu bar on the 
desktop. You can select the number of Runes to be used in each match.

Kick Ass! How do I install it?
Install it, simply extract the zipfile into your Tournament Demo 
directory, then start a game of UT with RuneZ as your mutator.
