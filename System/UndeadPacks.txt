v1.04a
---------------
How to Install:
---------------
1. Install just like any mutator(copy the .int and .u files of the UndeadPack
   into your unrealtournament/system directory).
2. If the UndeadPack uses new classes make sure you put the name of the UndeadPack
   in your sever packages.

-----------
How to Run:
-----------
1. Start a practice session or a multiplayer server and select CorpseMania
   as the gametype.

2. Click Mutators and find the name of the UndeadPack you want to use 
   (ex. UndeadPack(Skaarj)).  Then add the UndeadPack to the list of mutators
   you want to use.  You can also select more then one UndeadPack to use at a time.
   
3. Then just setup CorpseMania as usual and when you start the game you see the new
   Undead types spawning instead of the normal Undead.

--------------------------
How to Make an UndeadPack:
--------------------------
1. First load up UnrealEd and select classes.
2. Then load the CorpseMania.u package.
3. After loading up the CorpseMania package click on the info>Mutator>UndeadPack class.
4. Right click on the UndeadPack class and select add new then type the name of the new
   UndeadPack(ex. KrallUndeadPack) and the name of the new UndeadPack
   package, you can use the same name if you want to.
4. Your new UndeadPack class should bow be created under UndeadPack.
5. Right click on the new UndeadPack and select default properties.
6. Click the UndeadPack defualt property so that it says, NewGhost, NewGhoul, etc.
7. Now all you have to do is to type the package and name of the class you want to replace
   previous Undead with(ex. Unreali.Krall).
8. After you are finished typing in all of the classes make sure you save your new UndeadPack.
----
9. When you are done saving it you must make a new .int file in your unrealtournament/system
   directory.
10. First load up notepad and make a new file called the name of your
    UndeadPack(ex. KrallUndeadPack.int).
11. Then type in the following lines:
    [Public]
    Object=(Name=UndeadPackPackage.UndeadPackClassName,Class=Class,MetaClass=Engine.Mutator,Description="Name of Undead Pack")
12. That's all there is to making a new UndeadPack, you should now be able to run you new
    UndeadPack following the How to Run steps above.
