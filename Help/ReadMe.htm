<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Lockups</h3>

<p>If Unreal Tournament GOTY locks up or crashes when you run it, then a list of
&quot;Safe Mode&quot; options will appear the next time you run it.&nbsp; To
access the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; options directly, start Unreal Tournament GOTY via the
&quot;Safe Mode&quot; icon available in the Start menu (Start/Programs/Unreal
Tournament/Safe Mode). This mode is similar to Windows 95's Safe Mode.
It runs with sound, DirectDraw, and 3D hardware support disabled. This way, you can
modify your options&nbsp; that may be causing
problems, then run the game again.</p>

<h3>Crashes</h3>

<p>If Unreal Tournament GOTY stops with a &quot;Ran out of virtual memory&quot; message, you
need to free up more hard disk space on your primary drive (C:) in order to play.
Unreal Tournament GOTY's
large levels and rich textures take up a lot of virtual memory.&nbsp; We recommend having
150 megabytes of free hard disk space for running the game, and 300 megabytes or more of
free hard disk space for the editor.</p>

<h3>Supported video card chipsets</h3>
<p>The following chipsets have been compatibility tested with UT GOTY and
are known to work without problems (assuming you are using the latest manufacturer-supplied
driver for your card):</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Matrox</strong> G400</li>
  	<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> TNT2, GeForce2, GeForce256</li>
  	<li><strong>ATI</strong> Rage Pro 128, Rage 6</li>
  	<li><strong>3Dfx</strong> Voodoo 2, Voodoo 3, Voodoo 5</li> 
	</ul>

<p>Visit the card manufacturer's website for the latest drivers for your video
card.  <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia</a> and 
<a href="http://www.3dfx.com">Voodoo</a>-based card owners should visit those companies'
websites to obtain the latest drivers for their cards.</p> 

<h3>Direct3D issues</h3>

<p>Some video cards ship with drivers which do not support Unreal Tournament GOTY
properly.&nbsp; If you experience any of the following problems, your Direct3D
driver may need updating:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crashes when starting up.</li>
  <li>Crashes when changing video resolutions.</li>
  <li>Corrupted textures: garbage pixels appearing on surfaces; unexpected
    bright flashy colors on the screen; incorrect textures on surfaces.</li>
  <li>Unusually slower performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any of these problems, please visit our <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Direct3d.htm">Get
A Fixed Direct3D Driver Page</a> on the web.</p>

<h3>OpenGL issues</h3>
<p>OpenGL rendering mode is considered unstable and should not be used. Select
Glide or Direct3D rendering modes instead.</p>

<h3>Forcing Direct3D or Glide rendering modes</h3>
<p>If you are confident your card can support Direct3D and/or Glide but these
modes do not appear in the video mode selection dialog, clicking the
"Show All Devices" radio button will allow you to manually choose a rendering
mode of your choosing. Forcing a rendering mode in this manner is only
recommended for advanced users.</p>

<h3>Sound issues</h3>

<p>The sound playback rate defaults to 22 kHz, which is optimal for Pentium machines with
MMX. If you have an older, non-MMX machine, you can get better performance (though lower
sound quality) by setting the playback rate to 11 kHz in the &quot;Advanced Options&quot;
menu. If you have a fast, shiny new Pentium II, you might try using 44 kHz for the
ultimate in sound quality.</p>

<p>If using an Aureal A3D 3D sound accelerator board such as the Diamond Monster Sound 3D,
you need to go into &quot;Advanced Options/Audio&quot; and turn on
&quot;Use3dHardware&quot; to enable 3D sound card support. You need to upgrade to the
latest version of Aureal's A3D drivers in order to get acceptable 3D sound performance.
Using Unreal Tournament GOTY in conjunction with earlier versions of the drivers causes severe
&nbsp; performance problems (major slowdowns on the order of 30-50% while playing sound).</p>

<p>If your computer is hooked up to a Dolby SurroundSound receiver, you should go into
&quot;Advanced Options&quot; and turn on the &quot;UseSurround&quot; to take advantage of
360-degree Dolby sound panning, which rocks.</p>

<p>Known sound issues:

<ul>
  <li>A small number of computer configurations we've tested exhibit infrequent lockups when
    playing in full-screen DirectDraw (software rendered) mode using DirectSound for audio
    output.&nbsp; On most of these machines, going into &quot;Advanced Options/Audio&quot;,
    and turning off the &quot;UseDirectSound&quot; option prevented the lockups.&nbsp; Playing
    in a window also prevented the lockups.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Because of the way the OS works, many Windows NT machines experience significant latency
    in their sound effects, sometimes up to 1/4th second.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If you have an Aureal A3D sound card with 3D sound enabled, you must disable the
    Aureal's &quot;A3D Splash Screen&quot; in the Aureal configuration utility. If this is not
    disabled, the game may be unable to go into full-screen mode because of the splash screen
    interfering.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Network play issues</h3>

<p>The minimum speed connection for acceptable Internet play performance is a 28.8K modem
connection to your Internet Service Provider.</p>

<p>Known network play issues:

<ul>
  <li>When a new player enters a network game, clients may experience a 1/4-second pause while
    the mesh, skin, and other data is loaded for that player. This is by design.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Unreal Tournament GOTY's Internet play performance is highly dependent on the bandwidth of your
    connection, the latency (ping time), and the packet loss.&nbsp; The game is designed to be
    playable up to 300 msec ping times, 5% packet loss, and 28.8K connection speeds.
    Performance degrades heavily under worse latency, packet loss, and bandwidth connections.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Control issues</h3>

<p>Some PC keyboards can't recognize certain combinations of 3 or more simultaneously
pressed keys.</p>


<h3>Rocket Arena issues</h3>
<p>Users should note that activating any of the Relic Mutators on a server running 
Rocket Arena will lead to unexpected behavior and/or server crashes. For this reason,
use of any of the Relic mutators in Rocket Arena should be avoided.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>Unreal Tournament GOTY's performance is highly dependent on the amount of RAM you have in your machine,
and the amount of memory that is available. Machines with less memory will access their
hard disk more frequently to load data, which causes sporadic pauses in gameplay. Thus, if
you have a 32 megabyte (or less) machine, you should make sure that you don't have other
unnecessary programs loaded in memory when playing Unreal Tournament GOTY.</p>

<p>How the game will perform under different RAM conditions:

<ul>
  <li>32 megabytes or less: Probably unplayable.</li>
  <li>48 megabytes: Some swapping; use the Preferences/Video &quot;low texture
    detail&quot; setting to improve this.</li>
  <li>64 megabytes: Great, with a bit of swapping.</li>
  <li>128 megabytes: Oh Yes!</li>
</ul>

<h3>CPU Speed</h3>

<p>The game is also very sensitive to CPU speed, memory bandwidth, and cache performance.
&nbsp; Thus, it runs far better on leading-edge processors such as Pentium II's than it
does on older ones such as non-MMX Pentiums.</p>

<p>How Unreal Tournament GOTY will perform on different classes of machines:

<ul>
  <li>Non-MMX P166 class machines: Slow rendering; large frame rate variations. We recommend
    playing in 320x200 resolution if available. We recommend setting the sound playback to
    11025 Hz.<br>
  </li>
  <li>P200 MMX: Good rendering speed; some frame rate variations. We recommend running low
    resolutions like 320x240 or 400x300. We recommend keeping the sound playback at 22050 Hz.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pentium II; K6-2 with 3DNow!: Very nice rendering speed; consistent frame rate. Software
    rendering runs smooth in 512x384, 32-bit color resolution. You might try 44 kHz audio for
    best sound quality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Considering upgrading?</h3>

<p>For people considering upgrading their machines, here are some tips based on our
experience running Unreal Tournament GOTY on a variety of machines:

<ol>
  <li>The biggest performance gain in Unreal Tournament GOTY comes from having a Pentium II class processor.
    &nbsp; Pentium II's have dramatically improved cache performance, memory performance, and
    floating-point performance compared to earlier Pentiums, and that all translates to faster
    gameplay.&nbsp; The performance improvements in Pentium II's are especially accentuated in
    Unreal Tournament GOTY, which contains way more content (textures, sounds, animations, level geometry)
    than other 3D action games.</li>
  <li>The next upgrade that tends to improve Unreal Tournament GOTY performance dramatically is a 3dfx Voodoo
    or Voodoo2 class 3D accelerator. Especially in conjunction with a Pentium II processor,
    these accelerators rock!</li>
  <li>Finally, lots of RAM helps.&nbsp; With memory prices continually falling, it's now
    reasonably affordable to upgrade to 64 or 128 megabytes of memory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Minimum system requirement:

<ul>
  <li>233 MHz Pentium MMX or AMD K6 class computer.</li>
  <li>32 megabytes of RAM.</li>
  <li>4 megabyte video card.</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical system:

<ul>
  <li>300 MHz Pentium II or AMD K6-3.</li>
  <li> 64 megabytes of RAM.</li>
  <li>3dfx Voodoo 2 / Riva TNT class 3d accelerator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Awesome system:

<ul>
  <li>Pentium III 500 or AMD Athlon 550 or faster PC.</li>
  <li> 128 megabytes of RAM.</li>
  <li>3dfx Voodoo3 / Riva TNT2 class 3D accelerator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Better UT Performance</h3>

<p>The first thing to do is to increase your minimum desired framerate.  UT will try to meet your framerate
requirements by subtly dropping detail levels during complex scenes and fire fights.  The default
MinDesiredFrameRate is dependent on the speed of your computer.  If you have hardware acceleration
and a 300MHz or better CPU the MinDesiredFrameRate defaults to 30, otherwise it is 20.  The higher
the framerate, the more aggressive Unreal Tournament GOTY will be in eliminating excess special effects
and detailing.  To change the value open Advanced Options and click on Display.  There will be an
edit tab for the MinDesiredFrameRate variable.  The change will take place immediately.</p>

<p>If increasing MinDesiredFrameRate doesn't help, try decreasing your texture detail levels in the
Preferences window.  You can also try lowering your screen resolution.</p>

<hr>

<h2>
 Controls</h2>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<p>You can bind new keys to controls by clicking on the "Controls" tab of the Preferences menu
inside of Unreal Tournament GOTY.  There are a lot of controls to bind, so here is a list of defaults.</p>

</TABLE>

<h3>Mouse</h3>

<p>Although you can rely solely on your keyboard to move around in and interact in
Unreal Tournament GOTY's 3D universe, using both the keyboard and mouse simultaneously gives you much more
fluid and responsive control.</p>

<p>When you use the mouse to control your rotational movement and aiming you gain a degree
of precision and speed that players using keyboard-only controls can't touch. The keyboard
is best used for easy lateral and forward/backward movement, and for jumping.</p>

<p>To master the default controls in Unreal Tournament GOTY, keep your left hand on the keyboard, using
the arrow keys for movement, the 0-9 keys for weapon selection, and the space bar for
jumping. Your right hand operates the mouse, controlling rotation, aiming, and firing. Of
course, you can customize these controls to suit your preferences via the Options Menu.</p>

<h3>Speech Menu</h3>

<p>Press and hold the V key to open the speech menu.  While you hold V your mouse will become
activated and you can select various commands and taunts.  Under the <b>Orders</b> submenu
you can select a job to assign to a teammate.  If your bot is a teammate they will automatically
carry out your orders.  The available orders are:</p>

<DL>
<DT><B>Defend the Base.</B></DT>
<DD>The ordered bot will immediately make his way to your base and protect it from enemy attack.
<DT><B>Cover Me.</B></DT>
<DD>The bot will find you and follow you attacking enemies that you encounter.
<DT><B>Assault the Base.</B></DT>
<DD>Orders the bot to go offensive.  In CTF this order is replaced with "Capture the Enemy Flag."
<DT><B>Hold this Position.</B></DT>
<DD>The bot will find your current location and try to protect it from enemy attack.
<DT><B>Freelance.</B></DT>
<DD>Releases the bot from previous orders.  A freelancing bot will make their own battlefield decisions.
</DL>

<p>If you give an order to "All" then every bot on your team will attempt to complete the order.  If you look
at a bot the speech menu will have the option to "Order This Bot."</p>

<h2>
 Dedicated
Network Servers</h2>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>For optimal network play performance, you can launch a dedicated copy of the Unreal
Tournament server on a computer.&nbsp; This improves performance compared to using a non-dedicated
server but, of course, it ties up a PC.</p>

<p>Anybody may freely run dedicated servers on the Internet; you don't need to
get permission or fill out any paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p>You can launch a dedicated server by going through the regular Unreal
Tournament &quot;Start
Game&quot; menu, setting the appropriate options, then choosing &quot;Launch Dedicated
Servers&quot;.&nbsp; This is what you'll want to do for quick LAN games where you have an
extra machine sitting around that can act as a dedicated server.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can launch a dedicated server from the command line by running
UnrealTournament.exe directly (which usually resides in the c:\UnrealTournament\System directory, or the
System subdirectory of whatever other directory you installed the game in).&nbsp; For
example, to launch the level &quot;DM-Zeto.unr&quot;, run:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; UnrealTournament.exe DM-Zeto.unr -server</p>

<h3>Multiple Servers Per Machine</h3>

<p>Each copy of the dedicated server can serve one and only one level at a time.</p>

<p>However, you can run multiple level servers on one machine. To do this, you must give
each server a unique TCP/IP port number. The default port number is 7777. To specify
a port, use the following kind of command line:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; UnrealTournament.exe DM-Zeto.unr port=7778 -server</p>

<h3>General performance guidelines</h3>

<p>We find that a 400 MHz Pentium II can usually handle about 16 players with decent
performance.&nbsp; The performance varies with level complexity and other machine speed
factors, so your mileage may differ.&nbsp; Note that there is no absolute maximum player
limit in the game; performance simply degrades as the number of players grows huge.</p>

<p>If you're running multiple levels simultaneously, Windows NT outperforms Windows 95
because of its superior multitasking and TCP/IP processing capabilities.</p>

<p>For best performance, we recommend having 64 megabytes of memory per running level.
&nbsp; For example, for running 4 simultaneous levels, 256 megabytes is ideal.</p>

<p>The Unreal Tournament GOTY server uses up at least 28.8Kbits per second of outgoing bandwidth per
player (on Internet), so if you run the server on a machine connected by a 28.8K modem,
you'll only be able to support one client with decent performance.&nbsp; Dedicated servers
that support many players generally require the outgoing bandwidth of a T1 line or better.</p>
